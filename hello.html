        Hello World!


        <p>
            When trying to save our work in git it is called a commit. You have to tell git to save the 
            work so far. To do that the first command to use is 'git add <filename>'. After this
            the next time you hit save on the file it will keep track of the work. To save it you use
            "git commit" followed by '-m' which is a message or description of
            changes youve made
        </p>

        <p>
            To then push the changes up to git hub you use other commands. To check whats currently happenning
            in your repository use 'git status' and it will tell you what branch youre on and if its ahead of the
            repository on github. Use 'git push' to push those changes to the repository.
        </p>

        <p>
            To add all  the changed files, commit and add a message you use 'git commit -am'
            then use 'git push'
        </p>
